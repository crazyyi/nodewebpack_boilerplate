# Node.js Webpack boilerplate project

This project is a boilerplate for webpack enabled Nodejs + socket.io projects.

It uses [Yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/) instead of `npm` to  manage modules, simply because `Yarn` is faster.

This boilerplate uses features from ES2015, eslint and babel, eslint configuration is in `package.json`.

Before you run, run `yarn` command to install all the packages.

Use this to run dev server

```
yarn start
```
